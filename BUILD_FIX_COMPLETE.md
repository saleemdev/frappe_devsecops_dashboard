# Build Workflow Fix - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified

After running `bench build --app frappe_devsecops_dashboard`, the new React components (ChangeRequestsDashboard.jsx and IncidentsDashboard.jsx) and backend API changes were not appearing in the application.

**Root Cause:** The components were created and built, but NOT integrated into the application routing.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Import New Components
**File:** `frontend/src/App.jsx` (Lines 18-37)

Added imports for the new dashboard components:
```javascript
import ChangeRequestsDashboard from './components/ChangeRequestsDashboard'
import IncidentsDashboard from './components/IncidentsDashboard'
```

### Step 2: Add Routes
**File:** `frontend/src/App.jsx` (Lines 334-351)

Added route cases to handle navigation to the new dashboards:
```javascript
case 'change-requests-dashboard':
  return <ChangeRequestsDashboard />
case 'incidents-dashboard':
  return <IncidentsDashboard />
```

### Step 3: Add Navigation Menu Items
**File:** `frontend/src/App.jsx` (Lines 420-454)

Added menu items in the Ops menu for easy navigation:
```javascript
{
  key: 'change-requests-dashboard',
  label: 'CR Dashboard'
},
{
  key: 'incidents-dashboard',
  label: 'Incidents Dashboard'
}
```

## 🔍 Build Logging Explanation

**Question:** Why don't I see the build.py output during `bench build`?

**Answer:** Frappe's build system captures stdout/stderr from build commands. This is normal behavior.

**To see the output directly:**
```bash
cd apps/frappe_devsecops_dashboard/frontend
python build.py
```

**Output will show:**
```
