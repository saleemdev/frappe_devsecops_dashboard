# ✅ Stakeholder Sprint Report - Implementation Complete

## Summary

The Sprint Report feature has been successfully refactored to include a **Stakeholder-Focused View** that provides executives and non-technical stakeholders with a simplified, high-level overview of sprint progress. The implementation is complete, tested, and ready for production deployment.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Backend Implementation ✅
- **New GraphQL Query**: `get_stakeholder_sprint_query()` - Optimized query fetching only essential fields
- **Metrics Calculation**: `calculate_stakeholder_metrics()` - Computes stakeholder-focused metrics

- **API Endpoint**: `get_stakeholder_sprint_report()` - New whitelisted endpoint at `/api/method/frappe_devsecops_dashboard.api.zenhub.get_stakeholder_sprint_report`

**Features:**
- Caching with 5-minute TTL
- Permission checking
- Error handling with detailed error types
- Graceful fallbacks

### 2. Frontend Service ✅
- **New Method**: `getStakeholderSprintReport()` in `zenhub.js`
- **API Configuration**: Added `stakeholderReport` endpoint to `config.js`
- **Features**: Caching, retry logic, force refresh capability

### 3. New Component ✅
- **StakeholderSprintReport.jsx**: Executive-level sprint report component
- **Displays**: Sprint overview, progress, issues, story points, team workload, health indicators
- **Features**: Responsive design, refresh capability, error handling

### 4. Enhanced Dialog ✅
- **SprintReportDialog.jsx**: Added report mode selector
- **Features**: Toggle between Stakeholder View and Detailed View
- **Consistency**: Same dialog used across all three project views
