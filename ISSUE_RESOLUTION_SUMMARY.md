# üéØ Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Statement
**"The 'New Project' button on the project cards doesn't work - clicking it does nothing"**

---

## Root Cause
The Dashboard component's "New Project" button was calling:
```javascript
navigateToRoute?.('projects')  // ‚ùå WRONG - Goes to Projects list
```

Instead of:
```javascript
navigateToRoute?.('project-create')  // ‚úÖ CORRECT - Goes to creation form
```

---

## Solution Applied

### Single File Changed
**File:** `apps/frappe_devsecops_dashboard/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`

**Line 337:**
```diff
- onClick={() => navigateToRoute?.('projects')}
+ onClick={() => navigateToRoute?.('project-create')}
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
bench migrate                                    # Build frontend
bench --site desk.kns.co.ke clear-cache        # Clear cache
```

---

## Result

1. User clicks "New Project" on Dashboard

### After Fix ‚úÖ
1. User clicks "New Project" on Dashboard
