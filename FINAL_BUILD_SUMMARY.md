# Final Build Workflow Summary

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The build workflow for the DevSecOps Dashboard is **fully functional and production-ready**. The issue preventing new components from appearing was that they were created and built but not integrated into the application routing.

## 🔍 Diagnosis Results

### What Was Working ✓
- ✅ Vite build system generating hashed assets
- ✅ Manifest file creation with correct hashes
- ✅ HTML template updating with fallback hashes

```
bench build --app frappe_devsecops_dashboard
    ↓
Frappe links public assets
    ↓
Executes: cd frontend && python build.py
    ↓
build.py runs npm run build
    ├─ Vite compiles React components
    ├─ Generates hashed assets
    ├─ Creates .vite/manifest.json
    └─ Outputs to public/frontend/assets/
    ↓
build.py extracts hashes from manifest
    ├─ Reads .vite/manifest.json
    ├─ Extracts JS and CSS filenames
    └─ Removes 'assets/' prefix
    ↓
build.py updates HTML template
    ├─ Reads devsecops-ui.html
    ├─ Updates FALLBACK_JS constant
    ├─ Updates FALLBACK_CSS constant
    └─ Writes updated HTML
    ↓
Cache cleared
    ↓
Application loads with new components
